# Claude Code Stop hook: blocks Claude from finishing a turn while `dotnet build` fails.
# - Always builds, non-incrementally: timestamp-skip heuristics false-green deletions and
#   renames (mtime survives both), and an up-to-date compile skip would hide warnings that
#   an earlier plain build already tolerated — --no-incremental forces the compiler to run
#   (measured ~1.1s on this solution).
# - Warnings block too (-warnaserror): the repo's contract is a 0-warnings build.
# - Loop guard: if a block already triggered a fix attempt this turn (stop_hook_active), notifies the user via systemMessage (naming the current top error) instead of blocking again.
# - Fail-open: environment problems (bad cwd, missing jq, missing dotnet, missing strong-name key) disable the gate instead of trapping Claude.
